                    <h3> Introduction</h3>
                    
                    <hr>
                    Bicycling is for everyone
                    
                    More than 42 million Americans 6 and older—15% of the population—rode a bike for recreation in 2010, making it the
                    second-most-popular outdoor activity in the U.S.
                    In 2009, Americans made 4 billion trips by bicycle.
                    
                    Bicycling is the ideal way to take short trips
                    
                    Most trips Americans make are short: 50% are less than 3 miles, 40% are less than 2 miles, and 28% are less than 1 mile.
                    
                    Bicycling can help you live longer and better
                    
                    Adults who bike to work have better weight, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
                    Women who bike 30+ minutes a day have a lower risk of breast cancer.
                    Adolescents who bicycle are 48% less likely to be overweight as adults.
                    
                    Bicycling boosts the economy
                    
                    The U.S. bike industry supports 1.1 million jobs and generates $1.8 billion in taxes.
                    Homes closer to bike paths are more valuable.
                    Bicycling can reduce obesity and overweight, which cost the U.S. $270 billion per year.
                    
                    Bicycling is less expensive than driving—for individuals and society
                    
                    The average American household spends $8,758 per year on car payments and vehicle operating expenses – more than they
                    spend on food.
                    On a round-trip commute of 10 miles, bicyclists save around $10 daily.
                    For every two miles that someone bikes instead of drives, they save society $1.
                    
                    Bicycling reduces road congestion and air pollution
                    
                    Traffic congestion wastes 4.8 billion hours and 3.9 billion gallons of gas per year in the U.S., costing the country an
                    additional $115 billion.
                    For every 1 mile pedaled rather than driven, nearly 1 pound of CO2 is saved.
                    
                    Bicycling is safe, and together we can make it safer
                    
                    The health benefits of bicycling outweigh the risks by a factor of 20:1.
                    Safety in numbers: the more people who ride, the safer bicycling becomes.
